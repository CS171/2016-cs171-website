Welcome to CS171! This course is an introduction to key design principles and techniques for interactively visualizing data. The major goals of this course are to understand how visual representations can help in the analysis and understanding of complex data, how to design effective visualizations, and how to create your own interactive visualizations using modern web-based frameworks.

This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the Harvard General Education requirement for Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning. The course is also offered through the Harvard University Extension School as distance education course CSCI E-171. 

After completion of the course you will be able to:

* Critically evaluate visualizations and suggest improvements and refinements
* Apply a structured process to design interactive visualizations
* Iteratively generate visual encoding ideas using sketching and prototyping
* Use principles of human perception and cognition in visualization design
* Know various visualization methods to judge and create new designs
* Create web-based interactive visualizations using JavaScript and D3
* Work constructively as a member of a team to plan and carry out a complex project

###Prerequisites
You are expected to have programming experience (e.g,. CS50) and you should be comfortable picking up new programming languages on your own. 

In order to participate in labs, quizzes, and in-class activities, you will need to bring a laptop to all class meetings. Please restrict your laptop use to class-relevant activities. No social media, email, etc. because it distracts other students, not just you.

###Required Textbooks
We will be using two textbooks for this class, one to cover perceptual principles of visualization and one to teach the necessary technical skills.

[Visual Thinking for Design](http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Thinking-Kaufmann-Interactive-Technologies/dp/0123708966),  Colin Ware, Morgan Kaufman (2008)

*“All the clanking gears are here: variable resolution image detection, eye movements, environmental information statistics, bottom-up/top-down control structures, working memory, the nexus of meaning, and specialized brain areas and pathways. By the time he’s done, Ware has reconstructed cognitive psychology, perception, information visualization, and design into an integrated modern form. This book is scary good.” - Stuart Card, Senior Research Fellow, and manager of the User Interface Research group at the Palo Alto Research Center*
<br />

[Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://www.amazon.com/Interactive-Data-Visualization-Scott-Murray-ebook/dp/B00BSG68UQ), Scott Murray, O'Reilly (2013)
*[Free online version](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345)*

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/i/interactive_data_visualization.jpg)
*An introduction to D3 for people new to programming and web development, published by O’Reilly. “Explaining tricky technical topics with aplomb (and a little cheeky humor) is Scott Murray’s forte. If you want to dive into the world of dynamic visualization using web standards, even if you are new to programming, this book is the place to start.” - Mike Bostock, creator of D3*

##Course Components

###Lectures
The class meets weekly for lectures and joint class activities. Attending lecture is a crucial component of learning the material presented in this course. Please arrive on time, as in-class activities and occasional quizzes will begin promptly.

###Labs
For about half of the semester, the lectures will be replaced by programming labs during regular class time. Labs are self-guided tutorials with downloadable code that give you an introduction to client-side web programming with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and D3. 

###Readings & Quizzes
Each lecture and lab includes required readings to ensure that you are prepared for the activities in class. You are expected to complete the assigned readings before class. Short multiple-choice quizzes, due prior or at the beginning of each class, will test your knowledge of the readings. Completing them with your best effort will count towards your participation grade.
 
###Studios
Weekly studios are where you will have a chance to present and receive feedback on your work, discuss homework assignments, and collaborate as a team. **Studio attendance is mandatory.** Studios are limited to 15 students (the numbers may vary due to enrollment) and will be lead by a TF. Active participation in studio is expected and graded. For distance students we will organize complimentary online hangouts with the TFs. 

###Homework
Weekly homework assignments are going to provide an opportunity to improve your design and programming skills. See the homework as an opportunity to learn, and not to “earn points”. The homework will be graded holistically to reflect this objective.

###Midterm
The midterm exam will cover material from lectures, assigned readings, labs, and homework assignments. If you do not come to lecture and labs you will be at a severe disadvantage when studying for the midterm.

###Project
A major part of the course is a group project. You will work in groups of 3-4 students to design, implement, and evaluate visualizations through an iterative design process with a series of graded milestones. The final result will be web page with static and interactive visualizations that answer questions you have about some topic of your own choosing. 

##Grading

This course can be taken for a letter grade only; the "pass/fail" option is not available. The course grade comprises:

* Participation (15%) (quizzes, lectures, labs, studios, Piazza)
* Homework Assignments (25%)
* Midterm (20%)
* Group Project (40%)

Your final grade will be determined by the staff during an end-of-semester grading meeting where we discuss every student's performance in detail. 

##Course Policies

###Attendance Policy
Lecture and lab attendance is strongly encouraged and is considered in calculating your participation grade. There are several required class meetings such as the the midterm, guest lectures, group brainstorming, final presentations, etc.  We will call out the required attendance dates for these and others in the schedule. Please plan accordingly and do not miss these classes.

**Studio attendance is mandatory.** Sharing your work and discussing designs with others is an important part of your education. To receive credit for attendance, you must arrive on time. You are allowed two excused absences without penalty; thereafter you will receive zero credit for the missed studio. To receive an excused absence you must ask your studio TF in advance and receive an acknowledgment.

###Late Policy
All project-related due dates are final, and late submissions will receive a zero. Individual assignments (homework, etc.) lose 30% per day late. If you have a verifiable medical condition or other special circumstances that interfere with your coursework please let us know as soon as possible.  

###Collaboration Policy
You may discuss homework assignments with other people, but you are expected to be intellectually honest and give credit where credit is due. In particular, for all individual assignments:

* you have to write your solutions entirely on your own;
* you cannot share written materials or code with anyone else;
* you should not view any written materials or code created by anyone else for the assignment;
* you should list all your collaborators (everyone you discussed the assignment with) on your handin;
* you may not submit the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another; and 
* you may not provide or make available solutions to individuals who take or may take this course in the future.

If the assignment allows it you may use third-party libraries and example code, so long as the material is available to all students in the class and you give proper attribution. Failure to adhere to these policies may result in serious penalties, up to and including automatic failure in the course and reference to the ad board.

###Quoting Sources
You must acknowledge any source code that was not written by you by mentioning the original author(s) directly in your source code (comment or header). You can also acknowledge sources in a README.txt file if you used whole classes or libraries. Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers. 

###Accessibility
If you have a documented disability (physical or cognitive) that may impair your ability to complete assignments or otherwise participate in the course and satisfy course criteria, please meet with us at your earliest convenience to identify, discuss, and document any feasible instructional modifications or accommodations.

##Course Resources 

###Office Hours
The teaching fellows will provide office hours for individual questions that you might have about the homework assignments or project progress. Office hours are usually very heavily  attended. Please try to limit your visits to one office hour per week and consult Piazza first.   

###Discussion Forum
We use Piazza as our discussion forum and for all announcements, so it is important that you are signed up as soon as possible. Piazza should always be your first recourse for seeking answers to your questions. You can also post privately so that only the staff sees your message.  

###Online Materials
All class activity handout, slides, and required readings will be posted on Canvas. All lectures and labs will be recorded and videos will be available within 24 hours after class times.  

###Credits
Some of the material in this course is based on the classes taught by **Alexander Lex and Miriah Meyer** at the University of Utah, **Carlos Scheidegger** at the University of Arizona,  **Marc Streit** at JKU Linz, **Pat Hanrahan** at Stanford, **Jeff Heer** at the University of Washington, **Hans-Joerg Schulz** at the University of Rostock, **Nils Gehlenborg** at the Harvard Medical School, **Torsten Möller** at the University of Vienna, **Tamara Munzener** at the Univeristy of British Columbia, **Helwig Hauser** at the University of Bergen, and **Maneesh Agrawala** and UC Berkeley. We have heavily drawn on materials and examples found online and tried our best to give credit by linking to the original source. Please contact us if you find materials where the credit is missing or that you would rather have removed.
