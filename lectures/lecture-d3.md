## DOM Manipulation.
After we covered the basics of JavaScript last lecture it's now time to explore how javascript interacts with the DOM and thus makes all the interesting things in the browser happen. 
Like we’ve seen before, the HTML we write is represented as a tree inside a web browser. What we are going to turn to now are the JavaScript APIs that web browsers provide to let you edit the DOM dynamically, so that we can build our visualizations with code instead of text editors.

Let’s get some boilerplate out of the way. (Note that the following assumes that your document contains an element with id “hi”. If not, you’ll have to create one such element first)

{% include code.html id="dom_manipulation" file="dom_manipulation.html" code="" js="false" preview="true" %}










## Running a web server
---



In most cases, we need special software — a *server* — to view HTML files. 

You will need Python; you should already have it installed.

`cd` to `hw1/` and run the following.

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) — we have a server. You can open `table_example.html` to see an HTML file.

*show the relation between the files and the contents of the directory*

You can only have one server at the same time (unless you specify a port). Control-C to quit. 



### Manipulating the DOM

*Expand the console drawer in the Developer Tools Elements pane*

In addition to hardcoding SVG elements, we can use Javascript to programmatically add to the DOM.

```js
var svg = d3.select("svg");

var circle = svg.append("circle");
```

Why don't we see anything? The circle is in the DOM, but it needs attributes for its position and size.

```js
circle
    .attr("cx", 200)
    .attr("cy", 100)
    .attr("r", 40)
    .attr("fill", "steelblue");
```

How about more circles?

```js
var circle2 = svg.append("circle")
    .attr("cx", 300)
    .attr("cy", 100)
    .attr("r", 40)
    .attr("fill", "steelblue");
```

And of course, we can still update our original circle.

```js
circle
	.transition()
    .attr("cx", 400);
```

### Groups

We can group elements using `<g>` elements. First, we create a `<g>` element.

```js
var g = svg.append("g");
```

Let's move the two circles into the `<g>`.

```js
g.node().appendChild(circle.node());
g.node().appendChild(circle2.node());
```

Nothing changes — the `<g>` element just helps us group and organize elements.

We can apply transformations that apply to the whole group — for example, let's translate the group.

```js
g
  .transition()
  .attr("transform", "translate(0, 100)");
```
