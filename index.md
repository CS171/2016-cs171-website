The amount and complexity of information produced in science, engineering, business, and everyday human activity is increasing at staggering rates. The goal of this course is to expose you to visual representation methods and techniques that increase the understanding of complex data. Good visualizations not only present a visual interpretation of data, but do so by improving comprehension, communication, and decision making.

In this course you will learn how the human visual system processes and perceives images, good design practices for visualization, tools for visualization of data from a variety of fields, and programming of interactive web-based visualizations using [D3](http://d3js.org/).

The course is offered in the spring term 2016. Classes start on Tuesday, Jan 26. Attendance is mandatory, but additionally all classes are archived online. The course is open to all Harvard undergraduate and graduate students and can be taken through cross-registration from the GSD and MIT.

This course is also offered through the Harvard Extension school (online only) where it is listed as [CSCI E-171](http://www.extension.harvard.edu/courses/24028).
